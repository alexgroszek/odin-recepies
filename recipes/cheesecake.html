        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>I make this homemade cheesecake recipe every year for our work holiday party. It has a cinnamon and walnut crust that&rsquo;s easy to make from scratch and a fluffy vanilla filling. It&rsquo;s always a hit, and everyone compliments how delicious it is!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Crust</h4>
        <ul>
           <li>1 &frac12; cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
           <li>&frac14; cup finely ground walnuts</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar</li>
           <li>&frac12; cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, slightly beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

           <li>To make the crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, and cinnamon sugar in the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Add melted butter and mix well. Press into the bottom of the pan and 1 to 2 inches up the sides. Freeze until firm, about 10 minutes.</li>

           <li>While crust chills, make the filling: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Gradually beat in heavy cream on low speed until mixture is smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, on low speed until combined. Pour filling into crust.</li>

           <li>Bake in the preheated oven until center appears almost set when gently shaken, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool cheesecake on a wire rack for about 15 minutes.</li>

           <li>Run a butter knife around edge of cheesecake to loosen from pan. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Unclip the side of the pan and remove the ring. Let cool for another 30 minutes; chill in the refrigerator at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notes</h3>

        <p>This cheesecake improves after chilling &mdash; bake one day ahead for best flavor and texture. Use pecans or almonds in the crust for a different flavor, serve with whipped cream, fresh berries, or chocolate curls for garnish.</p>
