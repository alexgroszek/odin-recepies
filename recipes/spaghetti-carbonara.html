        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Our recipe for creamy spaghetti carbonara combines al dente pasta with egg yolks, cream, pancetta, and nutty Parmesan cheese for a rich and satisfying dinner that&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make at home. This take on the classic Italian dish takes only 25 minutes to make—it&rsquo;s perfect for those nights when you&rsquo;re craving a restaurant-worthy dish.</p>

        <p>Simply bring a pot of water to a boil as you crisp up some pancetta. While the pasta cooks, whisk together the egg yolks, cream, and cheese, then add this sauce to the hot noodles off the heat along with the pancetta. After a thorough toss, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a creamy, cheesy, just-salty-enough dish that&rsquo;s pasta perfection.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and pancetta to skillet, and cook until the pancetta is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, and keep warm.</li>

            <li>Cook spaghetti in boiling water until al dente, about 8 minutes.</li>

            <li>While spaghetti is cooking, whisk cream, egg yolks, Parmesan, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until combined.</li>

            <li>Drain pasta, and return to saucepan. Immediately stir in egg-and-cheese mixture until well combined.</li>

            <li> Add warm pancetta and fat from pan. Toss well. Thin sauce with additional cream, if necessary. Serve immediately, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Storing and reheating</h3>

        <p>Spaghetti carbonara is best eaten immediately, but it is possible to refrigerate and reheat leftovers. Store the dish in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two days.</p>

        <h4>How to reheat</h4>

        <p>To reheat, add a splash of water and microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring between each one, until hot throughout.</p>

        <h3>What to Serve With Spaghetti Carbonara</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve this creamy pasta dish with a bright, crunchy salad to counter the richness, such as our Asparagus-Walnut Salad, greens with a pickled-shallot vinaigrette, or a Classic Caesar Salad.</li>
            
            <li>A simple green vegetable, like braised green beans or sautéed broccolini, would also be a welcome accompaniment.</li>
        </ul>
