This will be my first project ever! I'm really excited to do this and I'm glad that i can learn new things. I will reflect on this once I'm done with this project.

EDIT:
I finished my first project! Although it wasnt't anything big, I learned new things like how to use an em dash and how to use fractions. I'm looking forward to keep learning new things and expanding my skills.
